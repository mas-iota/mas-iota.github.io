## What triggers a _Hard Build_ on our Apps

There are certain changes an app owner will do through our control panel that will trigger a hard build for apps to be resubmitted to iTunes or Google Store after the app owner hits publish. 

An app will need to go through a build process and be approved in order for certain changes to take effect. Once approved by iTunes and Google store, these changes will be reflected on the mobile devices after they download the latest version of that app.


### Here are the list of changes that will trigger a _Hard Build_

* Changing the Splash Screen from the Appearance page in the BuildFire Control Panel.
* Changing the App Icon from the Appearance page in the BuildFire Control Panel.
* Changing the App name from the Appearance page in the BuildFire Control Panel.

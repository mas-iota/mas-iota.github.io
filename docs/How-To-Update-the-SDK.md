# Updating the SDK
From time to time the BuildFire SDK is updated with new versions. If you are using the SDK to test your plugins, it's best to use latest version.

## BuildFire CLI
The recommended approach is to utilize [buildfire-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buildfire-cli). If you don't already have the SDK installed you can simply run the command: 

`npm install buildfire-cli -g` 

Once installed installed, simply run the following command from your SDK folder:

`buildfire update`

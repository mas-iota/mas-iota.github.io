Some features provided by BuildFire leverage reserved collections in our [App Data](/docs/app-data) and [Search Engine](/docs/Search-Engine) services.

These collections expand on existing systems to provide additional features. Using the tags reserved for these collections can cause issues within the app; therefore, using these tags is not recommended.

## List of Reserved Collections
